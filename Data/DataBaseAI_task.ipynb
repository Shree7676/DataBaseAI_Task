The caps have two layers, which makes them perfect for any night time routine you may have going, oils, different products, etc. Since there are 4 caps in the packaging, you can switch them as often as you need. My experience - had no imprint on my head in the morning from the rubber band, didn't woke up during the night and had no problem falling asleep with it on.
