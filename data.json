The leather looks better but it is still soaking up all the conditioner within 48 hours of it being applied. Hopefully, after 4 bottles, my leather chair will be back in supple condition."

I was afraid the caps will be too loose or too small, but the rubber band around the rim that lets you adjust it makes them perfect for all head shapes and sizes, also for bigger volumes of hair. The caps have two layers, which makes them perfect for any night time routine you may have going, oils, different products, etc. Since there are 4 caps in the packaging, you can switch them as often as you need. My experience - had no imprint on my head in the morning from the rubber band, didn't woke up during the night and had no problem falling asleep with it on. My hair looks better already after 2 nights and I'm not finding hair everywhere on our bed. Can only recommend."
